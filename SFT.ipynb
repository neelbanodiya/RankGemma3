Therefore, these two conformations must have different light-absorbing properties. Recall that the color of a substance is the complementary color of what it absorbs.

On the other hand, the deoxygenated conformation of hemoglobin absorbs light in the orange range, and it reflects blue light.',\n",

In physics, absorption of electromagnetic radiation is the way in which the energy of a photon is taken up by matter, typically the electrons of an atom.
